# python-sha-256

A simple python implementation of Secure Hashing Algorithm 256-bit (SHA256)

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is one of the cryptographic hash functions in the SHA-2 family. It generates a fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, typically represented as a hexadecimal number. SHA-256 is widely used in various cryptographic applications and protocols to ensure data integrity and security. It operates by repeatedly applying a series of logical and arithmetic operations to input data, producing a unique hash value that is highly sensitive to even small changes in the input.


## Usage

The explanation of the working of each function in the file is documented in the files as comments

Clone the repo. Open the repo on the Terminal

```bash
  cd python-sha-256
```
Run the **main.py** file and the path of the file to be encoded (Incase of path recognition issues place the target file in the repo folder)

```bash
  $ python src/main.py
    Input the path of the hash :
      <Enter your path>
```

After completion of hashing, the output will be generaated and stored in the **output.txt** file.
